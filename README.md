# Instagram Impressions Prediction Project

This repository contains code for an Instagram Impressions Prediction project using a Passive Aggressive Regressor. The project utilizes the 'Instagram.csv' dataset to explore relationships between various features such as likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, follows, and the total impressions of Instagram posts. Visualizations include distribution plots, pie charts for impressions from different sources, and word clouds generated from post captions and hashtags.

## Files

- `instagram_impressions_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model training.
- `Instagram.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and training.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `wordcloud`, `sklearn`).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code.
3. Explore visualizations, such as distribution plots and word clouds, to gain insights into Instagram post data.
4. Understand the relationship between various features and impressions using scatter plots with trendlines.
5. Train the model using a Passive Aggressive Regressor to predict impressions based on features.

## Summary

This project aims to predict Instagram impressions based on various engagement metrics. Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of impressions and the relationship between features. The Passive Aggressive Regressor is trained to predict impressions, offering a potential tool for users to estimate the impact of their posts on the platform. The project contributes to understanding engagement dynamics on Instagram, offering valuable insights for content creators and social media enthusiasts.
